Automatic Number Plate Recognition 
 It is end to end object detection with OCR implemented project.
 Where the number plate of vechile gets localize after that I crop that number plate part and send it to OCR alogorithm to extract text from that number plate. Then I use one government website(https://vahan.nic.in/) from where I can get all the detail regrading owner of the vechile and all. This is use in traffice survillence, parking area or monitoring any type of issue related to that vehcile. The only thing we need for our model is cctv footage to automate the whole thing using computer vision technique.
